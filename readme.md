- All of the datasets used in this project are available on the Internet.

- Download those required datasets before running the code, remember to modify the path in the code.

- <span style="background:yellow">Python3.9, Pytorch 2.1.0, GPU required.</span>

- Brief description of folders and files in the program:

  > + "data\process\\": preprocessed data will be stored here.
  > + "data_preprocess\\": files to preprocess data.
  > + "data_util\\": code to further process preprocessed data.
  > + "results\\": folder to store results of prediction and trained models.
  > + "main.py": entrance of the program.
  > + "utils.py": tool functions.
  > + others: code for each module in the model.

- To run the code, run files in foler "data_preprocess" first, then run files in "data_util" and finally run file "main.py".
